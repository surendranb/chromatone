# Ambient Noise Generator App â€” Project Plan

## Guiding Principles
- **Iterative Development:** After each phase, user testing will be conducted in Android Studio, and feedback will be incorporated before proceeding.
- **Version Control:** A git commit will be made at the end of every phase with a descriptive message.
- **Lightweight & Private:** The app will be designed to be lightweight and private, with a target size under 30MB as a guideline, not a strict limit. Functionality will not be compromised for size.
- **Autonomous Execution:** The assistant will operate independently, consulting the user only when a decision is unclear or input is needed.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture
- Initialize Android project (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose)
- Set up MVVM architecture
- Configure for small APK size

### Phase 2: Core Features Implementation
- Real-time synthesis for six noise types (White, Pink, Brown, Green, Blue, Violet)
- Audio playback engine (efficient, low-latency)
- Background playback (Foreground Service, persistent notification)
- Timer functionality

### Phase 3: User Interface & Experience
- "Flip through" card/swipe interface for noise selection
- Unique color/animation for each noise type
- Playback controls (Play/Pause, volume, timer)
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Notification UI

### Phase 4: Optimization & Polish
- Performance and battery optimization
- App size reduction
- Offline capability
- Stability and responsiveness

### Phase 5: Testing & QA
- Unit and instrumentation tests
- UI/UX testing on various devices
- Battery/resource testing

### Phase 6: Launch Preparation
- Final polish and bug fixes
- Documentation
- Release build and Play Store prep
